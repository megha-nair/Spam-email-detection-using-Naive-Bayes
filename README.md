# Spam-text-message-detection-using-Naive-Bayes
This project offers a robust implementation of a spam text message classifier using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm within the scikit-learn library. Beginning with the loading of a dataset containing spam messages into a pandas DataFrame, the code ensures data integrity by handling any missing values. It then proceeds to split the dataset into features and the target variable, encoding the latter for compatibility with the classifier. Through the use of scikit-learn's train_test_split function, the data is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.

The heart of the classification process lies in the construction of a scikit-learn pipeline, simplifying the workflow by combining feature extraction and model training. Leveraging CountVectorizer for text feature extraction and MultinomialNB for classifier implementation, the pipeline is trained on the training set to learn the underlying patterns within the data. Subsequently, the pipeline is evaluated on the testing set, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall providing insights into the model's performance.

Beyond evaluation, the trained pipeline stands ready for real-world application, capable of classifying new text messages as either spam or non-spam with confidence. The code snippet demonstrates this functionality by showcasing the classifier's predictions on a set of example messages. By seamlessly integrating pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, this concise yet comprehensive code serves as a practical blueprint for building and deploying a spam text message classifier within larger projects
